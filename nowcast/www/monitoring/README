***********************************
Nowcast Monitoring Information Page
***********************************

The index.html file in this directory is used as the monitoring
information page for the Salish Sea NEMO nowcast automation system.

At present,
this page resides at /home/dlatorne/public_html/MEOPAR/nowcast/index.html
which makes it accessible at http://eos.ubc.ca/~dlatorne/MEOPAR/nowcast/.
Unfortunately,
the index.html file at that location must be a regular file,
not a symbolic link,
so the file in this directory may be out of sync with the deployed version.
Since the deployed version is public it is considered to be cannonical.

The ideal workflow for making changes to index.html is:

* Check for differences between the group-editable deployed version
  and the version-controlled file in this directory.
  If differences exist copy the deployed version into this directory
  and commit the update.

* Edit, test, and commit changes to the file here,
  then copy it to /home/dlatorne/public_html/MEOPAR/nowcast/ to make
  your changes public.
