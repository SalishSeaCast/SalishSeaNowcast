**STORM SURGE ADVISORY**

${'Extreme' if 'extreme' in conditions[tide_gauge_stn]['risk_level'] else 'Elevated'}
sea levels expected for the marine areas of ${city}

**Synopsis**:
Strong winds over the northeast Pacific Ocean are expected
to produce elevated sea levels near ${city}
${conditions[tide_gauge_stn]['humanized_max_ssh_time']}.
These elevated sea levels may present a flood risk to
coastal structures and communities at high tide.

${tide_gauge_stn_info(tide_gauge_stn, conditions)}

Wind speed and direction are averages over the 4 hours preceding
the maximum water level to give information regarding wave setup
that may augment flood risks.

**Risk Level:** ${conditions[stn]['risk_level'].title()}

**Maximum Water Level:** ${round(conditions[stn]['max_ssh_msl'], 1)} m

**Wind:** ${int(round(conditions[stn]['wind_speed_4h_avg_kph'], 0))} km/hr
