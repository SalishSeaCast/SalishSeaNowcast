"""SalishSeaCast worker that calculates NEMO runoff forcing file from day-averaged river
discharge observations (lagged by 1 day) from representative gauged rivers in all watersheds
and fits developed by Susan Allen.
Missing river discharge observations are handled by a scheme of persistence or scaling of
a nearby gauged river, depending on time span of missing observations.
