Results Figures for the Web Site
********************************

This section describes how figures are produced automatically from the results of nowcast system runs to appear on the daily pages that are linked from https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/nemo/results/.

Web site figures are generated by code modules stored in the :file:`nowcast/figure/` directory tree.
There are 3 sub-directories in that tree:

* :file:`comparison/`
* :file:`publish/`
* :file:`research/`

The :file:`comparison` directory contains modules for figures that compare model results to observations;
for example temperature and salinity comparisions at the deep ONC nodes,
and comparision of surface quantities to data from the ONC ferry instrument packages.

The :file:`publish` directory contains modules for figures that are considered to be "official" SalishSeaCast model product - results we have evaluated and believe to be of the best quality and accuracy.

The :file:`research` directory contains modules for figures that we're interested in looking at on a daily basis to gain insight into the model's performance.

The :file:`research` directory is generally where new figure modules should be put.

In Python terms,
those directories are namespaces from which figure modules can be imported:

* :py:obj:`nowcast.figures.comparison`
* :py:obj:`nowcast.figures.publish`
* :py:obj:`nowcast.figures.research`

Within each of those namespaces the figure-producing functions are organized into a module for each figure.
So,
for example,
the :py:mod:`nowcast.figures.publish.compare_tide_prediction_max_ssh` module contains the code to produce a figure showing a map of the Salish Sea with coloured contours
showing the sea surface height when it is at its maximum at a specified tide
gauge station.
The figure also shows 24 hour time series graphs of raw and corrected model water levels compared to the tidal prediction for the gauge location,
and water level residuals (the difference between the corrected model results and the tidal predictions).

The code in the figure modules is just the code that is specific to creating that one figure.
Generic functions that are useful in the creation of more than one figure are collected in the :py:obj:`nowcast.figures.shared` module.
Figure modules also often import modules from the :ref:`SalishSeaToolsPackage`.
For example,
:py:func:`salishsea_tools.viz_tools.set_aspect` is used to set the aspect ratio of a figure axes object appropriately for the Salish Sea NEMO model grid.
