***************************************
Nowcast Figures Development Environment
***************************************

This section explains how to set up an isolated `Conda`_ environment for nowcast web site figure development and testing.
The environment will have both the :kbd:`SalishSeaNowcast` nowcast system package,
and the :kbd:`salishsea-site` web site app package installed in it,
along with all of their dependencies.

.. _Conda: https://conda.io/en/latest/

The :kbd:`SalishSeaNowcast` and :kbd:`salishsea-site` packages use some Python language features that are not available in versions prior to Python 3.6,
in particular:

* `formatted string literals`_
  (aka *f-strings*)
* the `file system path protocol`_

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/
.. _formatted string literals: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings
.. _file system path protocol: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#whatsnew36-pep519

Figure development and web site operation both require access to the Salish Sea project :file:`/results/` directory tree.
So,
you should set up this environment on a Waterhole "fish" machine.

The following instructions assume that you have `Miniconda`_ installed.

.. _Miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

You will also need up-to-date clones of the following repositories from GitHub:

* NEMO_Nowcast: https://github.com/43ravens/NEMO_Nowcast
* moad_tools: https://github.com/UBC-MOAD/moad_tools
* tools: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/tools
* NEMO-Cmd: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/NEMO-Cmd
* SalishSeaCmd: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaCmd
* SalishSeaNowcast: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaNowcast
* salishsea-site: https://github.com/SalishSeaCast/salishsea-site

Assuming that all of those repositories are cloned,
one beside the other,
in a directory like :file:`MEOPAR/`,
and with the capitalization shown on the left above,
you can create and activate a figures development environment with these commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd SalishSeaNowcast
    $ conda env create -f envs/environment-fig-dev.yaml
    $ conda activate nowcast-fig-dev
    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable ../NEMO_Nowcast
    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable ../moad_tools
    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable ../tools/SalishSeaTools
    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable ../NEMO-Cmd
    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable ../SalishSeaCmd
    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable ../salishsea-site/
    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python3 -m pip install --editable .

The :kbd:`--editable` option in the :command:`pip install` command above installs the packages from the cloned repos via symlinks so that the installed packages will be automatically updated as the repos evolve.

To deactivate the environment use:

.. code-block:: bash

    (nowcast-fig-dev)$ conda deactivate
