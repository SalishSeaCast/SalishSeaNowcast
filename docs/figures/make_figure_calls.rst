.. _CallingMakeFigureFunctionsInTheMakePlotsWorker:

***************************************************************************
Calling :py:func:`make_figure` Functions in the :py:mod:`make_plots` Worker
***************************************************************************

This section discusses:

* how to test a website figure module in a test notebook that replicates the nowcast system automation context
* how to add calls to a figure module's :py:func:`make_figure` function to the :py:mod:`nowcast.workers.make_plots` nowcast system worker
* how to run the :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker in debugging mode to test that it renders a figure correctly

We'll use the :py:mod:`nowcast.figures.research.tracer_thalweg_and_surface` figure module as an example to create a nitrate thalweg and surface figure.

You should run your test notebooks and :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker tests in a :ref:`NowcastFiguresDevEnv`.
You can activate it with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ source activate nowcast-fig-dev


.. _FigureModuleTestNotebook:

Figure Module Test Notebook
===========================

Once you've created a website figure module,
you should create a notebook that tests it in the nowcast context.
The `TestTracerThalwegAndSurfaceModule`_ notebook in :file:`notebooks/figures/research/` is an example for the :py:mod:`nowcast.figures.research.tracer_thalweg_and_surface` module.

.. _TestTracerThalwegAndSurfaceModule: https://nbviewer.org/github/SalishSeaCast/SalishSeaNowcast/blob/main/notebooks/figures/research/TestTracerThalwegAndSurface.ipynb


.. _RegisteringMakeFigureCallsInTheMakePlotsWorker:

Registering :py:func:`make_figure` Calls in the :py:mod:`make_plots` Worker
===========================================================================

Website figure modules like :py:mod:`nowcast.figures.research.tracer_thalweg_and_surface` produce :py:class:`matplotlib.figure.Figure` objects.
The :py:mod:`nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker is the element of the nowcast system automation that renders the :py:class:`~matplotlib.figure.Figure` objects to image files.
After a NEMO run has completed the :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker is launched to call the :py:func:`make_figure` functions that are registered for the run type.
The figure objects returned by the :py:func:`make_figure` functions are rendered to files in the :file:`/results/nowcast-sys/figures/` tree.
Files in that tree are served to the web by the nowcast system figure server.

The :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker organizes figures by NEMO run type and plot type.
The :command:`python -m nowcast.workers.make_plots -h` command will show you a list of the run types and plot types.
At present the run types are:

* ``nowcast``
* ``nowcast-green``
* ``forecast``
* ``forecast2``

and the plot types are:

* ``research``
* ``comparison``
* ``publish``

:py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` also accepts a ``--run-date`` to specify the date of the daily nowcast system NEMO run to create the figure for.
Without ``--run-date`` today's date is used.

The :py:func:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots.make_plots` function uses paths defined in the nowcast system configuration file
(:file:`SalishSeaNowcast/config/nowcast.yaml`)
to set up a collection of commonly used paths and datasets such as:

* the results storage directory tree
* the weather forcing directory tree
* bathymetry and mesh mask files
* the BC and Washington coastline polygons file

Then :py:func:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots.make_plots` calls a :py:func:`_prep_*_fig_functions` function for the requested run type and plot type.
Those functions open the datasets that will be used to create the figure objects,
and return a data structure of information about the :py:func:`make_figure` calls that we want :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` to execute to render figures.
Adding an item to a :py:func:`_prep_*_fig_functions` function data structure is referred to as registering the :py:func:`make_figure` call.

To use the :py:mod:`nowcast.figures.research.tracer_thalweg_and_surface` to produce a figure that shows nitrate concentration on thalweg and surface slices we will register a call of its :py:func:`make_figure` function in the :py:func:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots._prep_nowcast_green_research_fig_functions` function:

.. code-block:: python

    def _prep_nowcast_green_research_fig_functions(bathy, mesh_mask, results_dir):
        ptrc_T_hr = _results_dataset('1h', 'ptrc_T', results_dir)
        fig_functions = {
            'nitrate_thalweg_and_surface': {
                'function': tracer_thalweg_and_surface.make_figure,
                'args': (ptrc_T_hr.variables['NO3'], bathy, mesh_mask),
                'kwargs': {'cmap': cmocean.cm.matter, 'depth_integrated': False}
            },
        }
        return fig_functions

That function presently loads only one results dataset,
from the hourly ``SalishSea_*_ptrc_T.nc`` file from a ``nowcast-green`` run.
If you wanted to also produce a salinity thalweg and surface figure you would need to add a line to load the corresponding ``grid_T.nc`` dataset,
something like:

.. code-block:: python

    grid_T_hr = _results_dataset('1h', 'grid_T', results_dir)

Each :py:func:`make_figure` call that we want :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` is described by a :py:obj:`dict` item in the :py:obj:`fig_functions` dictionary:

.. code-block:: python

    'nitrate_thalweg_and_surface': {
        'function': tracer_thalweg_and_surface.make_figure,
        'args': (ptrc_T_hr.variables['NO3'], bathy, mesh_mask),
        'kwargs': {'cmap': cmocean.cm.matter, 'depth_integrated': False}
    }

The key,
``nitrate_thalweg_and_surface`` is the the root part of the file name into which the figure will be rendered.
If :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` is run with the command-line options ``nowcast-green research --run-date 2017-04-29``,
it will stored the rendered figure with the file name :file:`nitrate_thalweg_and_surface_29apr17.svg`.

The value is a :py:obj:`dict` that defines how to call the :py:func:`make_figure` function.
It has 2 required key/value pairs,
and 2 optional ones.

The ``function`` key is required.
Its value is the name of the website figure module and the function in it to call (i.e. :py:func:`make_figure`) in dotted notation.
*Note that the value is a function object, so it is* **not** *enclosed in quotes.*
The website figure module must be imported at the top of the :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` module; e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    from nowcast.figures.research import tracer_thalweg_and_surface

The ``args`` key is required.
Its value is is a :py:obj:`tuple` containing the positional arguments that :py:func:`make_figure` is to be called with.

The ``kwargs`` key is optional.
Its value is a :py:obj:`dict` containing the keyword arguments and their values that :py:func:`make_plots` is to be called with.
If no keyword arguments are needed you can omit ``kwargs``.

The other optional key is ``format``.
Its value is the image format to use to store the rendered figure.
It defaults to ``svg``,
our preferred figure image format because it is a resolution-independent vector format.
The ``format`` key is provided for the occasional special instances when we want to save images as ``png`` bitmap images.

So,
the :py:obj:`fig_functions` item:

.. code-block:: python

    'nitrate_thalweg_and_surface': {
        'function': tracer_thalweg_and_surface.make_figure,
        'args': (ptrc_T_hr.variables['NO3'], bathy, mesh_mask),
        'kwargs': {'cmap': cmocean.cm.matter, 'depth_integrated': False}
    }

will result :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` doing the function call:

.. code-block:: python

    fig = tracer_thalweg_and_surface.make_figure(
        ptrc_T_hr.variables['NO3'], bathy, mesh_mask,
        cmap=cmocean.cm.matter, depth_integrated=False
    )

and storing the rendered :py:obj:`fig` in :file:`/results/nowcast-sys/figures/nowcast-green/ddmmmyy/nitrate_thalweg_and_surface_ddmmmyy.svg`.


.. _RunningMakePlotsWorkerToTestAFigure:

Running :py:mod:`make_plots` Worker to Test a Figure
====================================================

We can test that we have set up the necessary dataset loading and registered our :py:func:`make_figure` function correctly by running the :py:mod:`~nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker in debug mode to confirm that it renders our figure correctly.

#. If you haven't done so already,
   activate your :ref:`NowcastFiguresDevEnv`,
   and navigate to your :file:`SalishSeaNowcast/` directory:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ source activate nowcast-fig-dev
       (nowcast-fig-dev)$ cd SalishSeaNowcast/

#. Set up 2 environment variables that the nowcast system expects to find,
   and create a temporary logging directory for it to use:

   .. code-block:: bash

       (nowcast-fig-dev)$ export NOWCAST_LOGS=/tmp/$USER
       (nowcast-fig-dev)$ export NOWCAST_ENV=$CONDA_PREFIX
       (nowcast-fig-dev)$ mkdir -p $NOWCAST_LOGS


#. Run the :py:mod:`make_plots` worker:

   .. code-block:: bash

       (nowcast-fig-dev)$ python -m nowcast.workers.make_plots config/nowcast.yaml nowcast-green research --debug --test-figure nitrate_thalweg_and_surface --run-date 2017-04-29

   The command line elements are:

   * ``-m`` to tell Python to run a module
   * ``nowcast.workers.make_plots``, the module to run
   * ``config/nowcast.yaml``, the path and file name of the nowcast system configuration file
   * ```nowcast-green``, the run type
   * ``research``, the plots type
   * ``--debug`` to send logging output to the terminal and *not* communicate with the nowcast system manager process (**very important**)
   * ``--test-figure`` to produce a test figure
   * ``nitrate_thalweg_and_surface``, the key of the :py:func:`make_figure` call to test
   * ``--run-date``, to say what date's run results to render the figure for

   The output of a successful test should look something like::

     2017-05-05 17:11:16,119 INFO [make_plots] running in process 2993
     2017-05-05 17:11:16,120 INFO [make_plots] read config from config/nowcast.yaml
     2017-05-05 17:11:16,120 DEBUG [make_plots] **debug mode** no connection to manager

     2017-05-05 17:11:18,647 DEBUG [make_plots] shutting down

   It is particularly important that your output contains the line that tells you that your figure was saved::

     INFO [make_plots] /results/nowcast-sys/figures/test/nowcast-green/29apr17/nitrate_thalweg_and_surface_29apr17.svg saved

   You can transform that path into a URL like::

     https://salishsea.eos.ubc.ca/test/nowcast-green/29apr17/nitrate_thalweg_and_surface_29apr17.svg

   and visually check your figure in your browser.

   Alternatively,
   you can use the :program:`Image Viewer` program on your workstation to open the file at that path.
