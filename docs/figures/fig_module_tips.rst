Figure Module Tips
******************

This section contains pointers to useful visualization functions in the :kbd:`SalishSeaTools` package.
It also contains pointers to website figure module functions that do common things so that you can copy code rather than having to reinvent the wheel.


Format Date/Time Tick Labels on an Axes
=======================================

See :py:func:`nowcast.figures.publish.compare_tide_prediction_max_ssh._residual_time_series_labels` for an example of how to use a :py:class:`matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter` object to format date/time tick labels on an axes.


Correct Timezone for Axes Date/Time Tick Labels
===============================================

See :py:func:`nowcast.figures.publish.compare_tide_prediction_max_ssh._residual_time_series_labels` for an example of how to ensure that axes date/time tick labels produced by a :py:class:`matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter` object are correct when the time series data being plotted is timezone-aware..
