Nowcast Production Deployments
******************************

In October 2016 the production deployment of the nowcast system was changed to use the :ref:`SalishSeaNowcast-repo` package that is based on the `NEMO_Nowcast framework`_ framework.
The production deployment uses 3 systems:

.. _NEMO_Nowcast framework: https://nemo-nowcast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

#. The :py:mod:`nemo_nowcast.message_broker`,
   :py:mod:`nemo_nowcast.manager`,
   :py:mod:`nemo_nowcast.log_aggregator`,
   most of the pre- and post-processing workers run on the :ref:`SalishSeaModelResultsServer`, :kbd:`skookum`, where the deployment is in the :file:`/SalishSeaCast/` directory tree.

#. The development compute server,
   :kbd:`salish`,
   is used to run the daily development model run,
   :kbd:`nowcast-dev` NEMO-3.6 model run.
   :kbd:`salish` and :kbd:`skookum` share storage via NFS mounts,
   so,
   :kbd:`salish` uses the same deployment in the :file:`/SalishSeaCast/` directory tree.

#. The daily
   :kbd:`forecast2`
   (preliminary forecast),
   :kbd:`nowcast`,
   :kbd:`forecast`,
   and :kbd:`nowcast-green` NEMO-3.6 model runs are computed on a cluster of virtual machines provided by `Ocean Networks Canada`_ on the Compute Canada `arbutus.cloud`_ cluster.
   The shared storage for those VMs is provided by an NFS-mounted volume of ::kbd:`arbutus.cloud` `Ceph object storage`_.
   The nowcast deployment is in the :file:`/nemoShare/MEOPAR/nowcast-sys/` directory tree.

   In April 2017,
   daily :kbd:`wwatch3-nowcast`,
   daily :kbd:`wwatch3-forecast`,
   and :kbd:`wwatch3-forecast2`
   (preliminary wave forecast)
   WaveWatch IIIÂ® v5.16 wave model runs for the Strait of Georgia and Juan de Fuca Strait were added to the computations on :kbd:`arbutus.cloud`.
   The :kbd:`wwatch3-nowcast` and :kbd:`wwatch3-forecast` runs are executed in sequence after the daily :kbd:`nowcast-green` NEMO-3.6 runs.
   The :kbd:`wwatch3-forecast2` runs are executed after the daily :kbd:`forecast2` NEMO-3.6 runs.

   In January 2018,
   daily :kbd:`fvcom-nowcast`
   and :kbd:`fvcom-forecast` FVCOM v4.1-beta model runs for Vancouver Harbour and the Lower Fraser River were added to the computations on the :kbd:`arbutus.cloud`.
   They are executed in sequence after the daily :kbd:`nowcast` NEMO-3.6 runs.
   In January 2019,
   the resolution of the Vancouver Harbour and Lower Fraser River FVCOM v4.1-beta model was increased.
   Those runs are designated :kbd:`fvcom-nowcast-x2` and :kbd:`fvcom-forecast-x2`.
   In March 2019,
   an even higher resolution Vancouver Harbour and Lower Fraser River model configuration was added to the system,
   running daily nowcast runs as :kbd:`fvcom-nowcast-r12`.

These sections describe the setup of the nowcast system on :kbd:`skookum`/:kbd:`salish` and :kbd:`arbutus.cloud`,
and it operation.

In May 2018 production runs of a :kbd:`nowcast-green` configuration with AGRIF sub-grids for Baynes Sound and Haro Strait were added to the system.
Those runs are executed on a reserved chassis on :kbd:`orcinus`.
The setup on :kbd:`orcinus`,
as well are the sub-grid initialization preparation with the NEMO-AGRIF nesting tools are described in:

In February 2019 we got access to the UBC EOAS :kbd:`optimum` cluster.
We use it primarily for long hindcast runs,
but also some research runs.
The setup on :kbd:`optimum` is described in:
