Nowcast Production Deployment
*****************************

In October 2016 the production deployment of the nowcast system was changed to use the :ref:`SalishSeaNowcast-repo` package that is based on the `NEMO_Nowcast framework`_ framework.
The production deployment uses 3 systems:

.. _NEMO_Nowcast framework: https://nemo-nowcast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

#. The :py:mod:`nemo_nowcast.message_broker`,
   :py:mod:`nemo_nowcast.manager`,
   :py:mod:`nemo_nowcast.scheduler`,
   :py:mod:`nemo_nowcast.log_aggregator`,
   most of the pre- and post-processing workers run on the :ref:`SalishSeaModelResultsServer`, :kbd:`skookum`, where the deployment is in the :file:`/results/nowcast-sys/` directory tree.

#. The development compute server,
   :kbd:`salish`,
   is used to run the daily development model run,
   :kbd:`nowcast-dev` NEMO-3.6 model run,
   and the :py:mod:`nowcast.workers.make_live_ocean_files` worker that relies on Matlab.
   :kbd:`salish` and :kbd:`skookum` share storage via NFS mounts,
   so,
   :kbd:`salish` uses the same deployment is in the :file:`/results/nowcast-sys/` directory tree.

#. The daily
   :kbd:`forecast2`
   (preliminary forecast),
   :kbd:`nowcast`,
   :kbd:`forecast`,
   and :kbd:`nowcast-green` NEMO-3.6 model runs are computed on a cluster of virtual machines on the `Ocean Networks Canada`_ private cloud computing facility known as :kbd:`west.cloud` that is part of the Compute Canada `arbutus`_ cluster.
   The shared storage for those VMs is provided by an NFS-mounted volume of ::kbd:`west.cloud` `Ceph object storage`_.
   The nowcast deployment is in the :file:`/nemoShare/MEOPAR/nowcast-sys/` directory tree.

   In April 2017,
   daily :kbd:`wwatch3-forecast2`
   (preliminary wave forecast),
   and :kbd:`wwatch3-forecast` WaveWatch IIIÂ® v5.16 wave model runs were added to the computations on the ONC cloud.
   They are executed after the :kbd:`forecast2` and :kbd:`forecast` NEMO-3.6 runs.

These sections describe the setup of the nowcast system on :kbd:`skookum`/:kbd:`salish` and :kbd:`west.cloud`,
and it operation.

In May 2018 production runs of a :kbd:`nowcast-green` configuration with AGRIF sub-grids for Baynes Sound and Haro Strait were added to the system.
Those runs are executed on a reserved chassis on :kbd:`orcinus`.
The setup on :kbd:`orcinus`,
as well are the sub-grid initialization preparation with the NEMO-AGRIF nesting tools are described in:
