*******************************
:kbd:`SalishSeaNowcast` Package
*******************************

The :kbd:`SalishSeaNowcast` package is a collection of Python modules associated with running the Salish Sea NEMO model in a daily nowcast/forecast mode.
The runs use as-recent-as-available
(typically previous day)
forcing data for the western boundary sea surface height and the Fraser River flow,
and atmospheric forcing from the four-times-daily produced forecast results from the Environment Canada High Resolution Deterministic Prediction System (HRDPS) operational GEM 2.5km resolution model.

The runs are automated using an asynchronous,
message-based architecture that:

* obtains the forcing datasets from web services
* pre-processes the forcing datasets into the formats expected by NEMO
* uploads the forcing dataset files to the HPC or cloud-computing facility where the run will be executed
* executes the run
* downloads the results
* prepares a collection of plots from the run results for monitoring purposes
* publishes the plots and the processing log to the web

The automation architecture is presently under development.
It consists of a long-running manager process and a collection of worker processes which are launched by the manager or by cron to perform specific tasks.

The :kbd:`SalishSeaNowcast` package is a Python 3 package.
It is developed and tested under Python 3.5 and should work with that and later versions of Python.
