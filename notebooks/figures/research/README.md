The Jupyter Notebooks in this directory are for development and testing of
the results figures generation modules of the Salish Sea model nowcast system.

The links below are to static renderings of the notebooks via
[nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org).
Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[DevelopVelocitySectionAndSurfaceModule.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/DevelopVelocitySectionAndSurfaceModule.ipynb)  
    
    **Develop `velocity_section_and_surface` Figure Module**  
      
    Development of functions for `nowcast.figures.research.velocity_section_and_surface` web site figure module.  
      
    This is an example of developing the functions for a web site figure module in a notebook.  
    It follows the function organization patterns described in  
    [Creating a Figure Module](https://salishsea-nowcast.readthedocs.io/en/latest/figures/create_fig_module.html) docs.  

* ##[TestTracerThalwegAndSurface.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/TestTracerThalwegAndSurface.ipynb)  
    
    **Test `tracer_thalweg_and_surface` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.research.tracer_thalweg_and_surface` module.  
      
    Set-up and function call replicates as nearly as possible what is done in the `nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker  
    to help ensure that the module will work in the nowcast production context.  

* ##[PlacesandMapForTimeSeries.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/PlacesandMapForTimeSeries.ipynb)  
    
    **Sketch out a Map for Timeseries and Find Good Places ****  

* ##[DevelopFrontPlots.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/DevelopFrontPlots.ipynb)  
    
    **Develop `front_plots` Figure Module**  
      
    Development of functions for `nowcast.figures.research.front_plots` web site figure module.  

* ##[DevelopTracerThalwegAndSurfaceModule.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/DevelopTracerThalwegAndSurfaceModule.ipynb)

    **Test `time_series_plots` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.research.time_series_plots` module.  
      
    Set-up and function call replicates as nearly as possible what is done in the `nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker  
    to help ensure that the module will work in the nowcast production context.  

* ##[TestVelocitySectionAndSurface.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/TestVelocitySectionAndSurface.ipynb)  
    
    **Test `velocity_section_and_surface` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.research.velocity_section_and_surface` module.  
      
    Set-up and function call replicates as nearly as possible what is done in the `nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker  
    to help ensure that the module will work in the nowcast production context.  

* ##[TestTracerThalwegAndSurfaceHourly.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/TestTracerThalwegAndSurfaceHourly.ipynb)  
    
    **Test `tracer_thalweg_and_surface_hourly` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.research.tracer_thalweg_and_surface_hourly` module.  
      
    Set-up and function call replicates as nearly as possible what is done in the `nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker  
    to help ensure that the module will work in the nowcast production context.  

* ##[DevelopBaynesSoundAGRIF.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/DevelopBaynesSoundAGRIF.ipynb)  
    
    **Develop `baynes_sound_agrif` Figure Module**  
      
    Development of functions for `nowcast.figures.research.baynes_sound_agrif` web site figure module.  
      
    **Goal:** A 4 panel figures showing  surface values of  
    temperature, salinity, diatoms biomass, and nitrate concentration  
    at 12:30 Pacific time.  
    Each panel to show all of the Baynes Sound sub-grid as well as  
    a fringe of the full domain on the 3 non-land sides.  
    Ideally the axes tick labels will be lon/lat with angled grid lines.  

* ##[DevelopTimeSeriesPlots.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/research/DevelopTimeSeriesPlots.ipynb)  
    
    **Develop `time_series_plots` Figure Module**  
      
    Development of functions for `nowcast.figures.research.time_series_plots` web site figure module.
