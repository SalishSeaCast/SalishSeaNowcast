Descriptions under the links below are from the first cell of the notebooks
(if that cell contains Markdown or raw text).

* ##[TestTideStnWaterLevel.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/fvcom/TestTideStnWaterLevel.ipynb)  
    
    **Test `tide_stn_water_level` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.fvcom.tide_stn_water_level` module.  
    Provides data for visual testing to confirm that refactoring has not adversely changed figure for web page.  
      
    Set-up and function call replicates as nearly as possible what is done in the `nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker.

    **Test `surface_currents` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.fvcom.surface_currents` module.  
    Provides data for visual testing to confirm that refactoring has not adversely changed figure for web page.  
      
    Set-up and function call replicates as nearly as possible what is done in the `nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker.  

* ##[TestSecondNarrowsCurrent.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/fvcom/TestSecondNarrowsCurrent.ipynb)  
    
    **Test `second_narrows_current` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.fvcom.second_narrows_current` module.  
    Provides data for visual testing to confirm that refactoring has not adversely changed figure for web page.  
      
    Set-up and function call replicates as nearly as possible what is done in the `nowcast.workers.make_plots` worker.  

* ##[TestThalwegTransect.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/salishsea/salishseanowcast/raw/tip/notebooks/figures/fvcom/TestThalwegTransect.ipynb)  
    
    **Test `thalweg_transect` Module**  
      
    Render figure object produced by the `nowcast.figures.fvcom.thalweg_transect` module.  
    Provides data for visual testing to confirm that refactoring has not adversely changed figure for web page.
